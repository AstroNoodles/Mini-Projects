These are the bare bones documents for creating the Chemistry Facts skill available on the Amazon Alexa Skills store. It is incredibly simple to activate only requiring an Alexa device and the words: *"tell me a chemistry fact"*. 

It is written in Node.js after the Alexa Fact skill and requires the [ask-sdk library](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs). Special thanks to @Alexa for helping me learn how to make this and to help me make future AWS Alexa Skill apps.
